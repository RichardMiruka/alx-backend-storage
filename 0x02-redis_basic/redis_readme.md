Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Service.
Redis is an open-source, networked, in-memory database that stores data on the server side and supports data structures such as strings

A Redis database holds key:value pairs and supports commands such as GET, SET, and DEL, as well as several hundred additional commands.

Redis keys are always strings.

Redis values may be a number of different data types, including string, list, hashes, and sets

Many Redis commands operate in constant O(1) time, just like retrieving a value from a Python dict or any hash table.

Redis supports storing additional types of key:value data types besides string:string
